Proposito: The prupose of this program is to ask the user (an employee), their name and social security, their wage, and how many hours they worked.
           We then use this to calculate their gross salary, their net salary, and the ammount deducted from their gross salary. We then display this
           to the user, along with their information (name, social security).
